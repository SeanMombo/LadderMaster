## Patch 1.1 notes:
- new admin commands (for illuminati, not ladder managers):
    - 'addLadder': pretty self explanatory
        - you'll need to manually create a tab and format it in the google spreadsheet. Make sure to
        use the same format as the previous 
    - 'removeLadder': also self explanatory
    - 'changeLadderName: changes name of a ladder
- new general commands:
    - 'ladderDetailed': provides detailed ladder info on players
    - 'ladderStats': provides ladder statistics (only one stat for now, more coming)

Note: smush is now to be known as ssbu, please use this keyword exclusively in the future
