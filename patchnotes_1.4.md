## Patch 1.4 notes:
- made error messages less shit for !beat and !confirm commands
- made table rendering more robust since some FUCKER (moorglade) kept adding characters to his chess profile and breaking the discord character limit
- fixed previous error where a boss of 2 ladders would lose his role upon losing position on one of the ladders
- ladder boss role is automatic now
- wintracking now included for ladder boss
