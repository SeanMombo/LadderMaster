## Patch 1.2 notes:
- new ladder display shortcuts: !l for basic display, !ld for ladderDetailed, !ls for ladderStats (just doing my job to save yall's hands :D)
- added w/l stats, so you guys will need to start entering scores in the !beat and !confirm commands. It's basically !beat @opponent score game, where score is in the format 'x-y'. E.g. "!beat @seen 3-0 melee". You'll also have to confirm the score in the same way. See !help for more details.
- melee stats were getting over the 2k character limit, so I split up long tables.
Devnote: now gitignoring .pkl files to reduce the chance of accidentally wiping all the data
<<<<<<< HEAD
- spreadsheet updating should be fixed... i hope...
